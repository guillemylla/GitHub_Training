	- *"If you're an educator or a researcher, you can apply to receive GitHub Team for your organization account for free."* 
	- To "upgrade"  to Educator account follow this instructions : https://docs.github.com/en/education/teach-and-learn-with-github-education/apply-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount

### First time using git

 - The first time you use git in a computer, you need to configure it
 
 ```
 $ git config --global user.name "your_username"
 $ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
 ```

- Optional: if you want git to remember the password during a period of time.


```
git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=<seconds>'
```

At this point, you have creted a repository with a README file in GitHub and downloaded it to your computer.

## Branch

## Track file

- gt push
- git stash
- git fetch
- git merge
- git pull

Hands-on example


Create new repo

My first commit


- Can I create a cloud session? connected to a public repo on my account?

```
    git add FILE
    git commit -m "my first commit"
    git push origin main
     # main used to be called "master". Github recently removed unnecessary references to slavery
``` 



## Other things

- Host your websites
- Share posters (i.e. a QR code on your poster that redirects to the PDF hosted on github )
